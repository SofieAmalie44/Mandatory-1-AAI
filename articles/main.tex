Regression problem
Predict a continuous variable, e.g.:
Predict the car’s fuel efficiency (mpg) based on features like weight, horsepower, and cylinders.
So your target variable is mpg.
Logistic regression problem
Convert something into a classification problem, e.g.:
Predict whether a car is “high-efficiency” (mpg > median value) or “low-efficiency” (mpg ≤ median).
